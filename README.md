# Ecommerce_Lambda_Test
I have successfully developed a comprehensive Ecommerce Automation Framework from the ground up, leveraging Selenium with Java, Cucumber, and JUnit. This framework provides a seamless and efficient way to automate various aspects of the Ecommerce process.

The core objective of this project is to streamline and enhance the user experience in the Ecommerce domain. By automating the registration process, users can effortlessly create accounts and seamlessly access the platform. Additionally, the framework enables users to search for products with ease, add them to their carts, and proceed to the checkout process. This significantly reduces manual effort and ensures a consistent and reliable shopping journey.

The utilization of Selenium, Java, Cucumber, and JUnit empowers the framework with robust testing capabilities. By structuring the tests using BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) principles, the project ensures clear communication between the development and testing teams, promoting collaboration and enhancing the quality of the codebase.

Throughout the development of the framework, I overcame various challenges related to UI automation, data handling, synchronization, and maintaining the framework's scalability. Thorough testing and refinements were performed to ensure that the framework operates seamlessly across different browsers and platforms.

Key features of the framework include user registration automation, product search and selection, cart management, and an end-to-end checkout process. The project caters to a diverse range of users, providing them with a convenient and efficient way to navigate through the Ecommerce platform.

By automating the billing details filling during the checkout process, the framework ensures accuracy and eliminates potential errors. This not only improves the user experience but also contributes to the overall reliability of the system.

In conclusion, the Ecommerce Automation Framework I have created using Selenium, Java, Cucumber, and JUnit represents a significant advancement in the realm of automated testing. It addresses critical aspects of the Ecommerce journey, from user registration to product selection and checkout, while adhering to best practices and ensuring a seamless experience for both users and stakeholders.
